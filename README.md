# Rockman.exe-Reskin---Bjorn
This is a continuous project I am working on to reskin the BJORN cyber viking as megaman.exe

This was just for fun and a simple reskin on the Waveshare V4.

As I get more time I will probably also update the webUI visuals to match.



Just unzip the folders and copy and paste them into home/bjorn/resources/images  (or whatever directory your bjorn is in)


Its pretty much that simple.
